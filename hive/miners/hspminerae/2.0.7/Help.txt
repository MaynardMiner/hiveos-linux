#Mining Speed
	#P106,1060:	120n/min
	#1080ti	  :	260n/min

#Running requirements
	##AE:
		###win7,win10,Linux system
		###Nvidia,10 series graphics card, 4G or above video memory (1050ti please use linux version)
		###Nvidia driver version>398 (some users use 41X driver will be very slow, it is recommended to use 39X driver)
		###windows requires more virtual memory space than all memory sizes (for example, you have 1060 6G *2 cards, at least 12G of virtual memory)

#Instructions
	##AE
		##Windows system
			###Open the run.cmd file with txt file
			###Replace wallet address after -wal  (delete { })
			###(Optional) Replace the machine name after the -worker (usually used to distinguish the machines)
			###(Optional) Replace the pool address and port behind the -pool
			###(Optional) Replace the password for the connection pool behind -psw
			###Save, click to start run.cmd
			###(Optional) Click WebMonitor.cmd to open the browser (or open the browser directly) to view the mining status (in the presence of the -api parameter)

		##Linux system
			###Open the run.sh file with a text editor
			###Replace the wallet address after -bwal 
			###(Optional) Replace the name after the -worker (usually used to distinguish the machines)
			###(Optional) Replace the pool address and port behind the -pool
			###(Optional) Replace the password for the connection pool behind -psw
			###Save, console run./run.sh
			###(Optional) Click WebMonitor.cmd to open the browser (or open the browser directly) to view the mining status (in the presence of the -api parameter)
		
#Parameter Description
	##Aeternity related:
		###	-wal		AE mining Wallet Address(start with ak)
		###	-worker		AE mining machine name
		###	-pool		AE pool address, add tls://pool_url:port to enable TLS connection
		###	-psw		AE Mining Pool Password
		###	-device		AE mining enabled devices, defaults to all devices, with -bdevice 0, 2, 4 to limit running on GPU0, 2, 4 only
	##Running related:
		###	-api		Enable network monitoring address, for example: 192.168.1.2:16666, use browser to access http://192.168.1.2:16666, monitor mine operation
		###	-logfile	                Enables the log file. The default is to generate the file name according to the time. The file name can be specified later, such as -logfile hspminer.log
		###	-hide		Hide the interface immediately after starting the program, note that it will run in the background. If you open the api interface, you can click WebMonitor.cmd to start the browser monitoring (not available under Linux)
